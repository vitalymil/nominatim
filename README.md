Nominatim
=========

Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OpenStreetMap data
by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of
OSM points (reverse geocoding). An instance with up-to-date data can be found
at https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org. Nominatim is also used as one of the
sources for the Search box on the OpenStreetMap home page and powers the search
on the MapQuest Open Initiative websites.

Documentation

More information about Nominatim, including usage and installation instructions,
can be found in the docs/ subdirectory and in the OSM wiki at:

http://nominatim.org
